INTRODUCTION                                               *dn-md-utils-intro*

An auxiliary filetype plugin for the markdown language.

Previously the plugin author used a personal plugin to provide markdown-
related functionality. That plugin was retired when the plugin author switched
to the |vim-pandoc| plugin and panzer framework
(https://github.com/msprev/panzer) for markdown support. This plugin is
intended to address any gaps in markdown support provided by those tools.

DEPENDENCIES

Pandoc is used to generate output. It is not provided by this ftplugin. This
ftplugin depends on the |vim-pandoc| plugin and assumes panzer
(https://github.com/msprev/panzer) is installed and configured.

This plugin is designed for use with pandoc version 2.0. At the time of
writing this is the development branch of pandoc, while the production version
is 1.19. As the change in major version number suggests, the interfaces of
these two versions of pandoc are incompatible. Hence, this plugin will not
work with the current production version of pandoc. There are two known
incompatibilities between these versions that affect this plugin. The first is
that the "smart" feature has changed from an option ("--smart") to an
extension ("--from=markdown+smart"). The second is a change in the option used
to specify the latex engine from "--latex-engine" to "--pdf-engine".

This plugin also depends on the vim-dn-utils plugin
(https://github.com/dnebauer/vim-dn-utils).

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                             *dn-md-utils-config*

                                                       *b:disable_dn_md_utils*
Prevents this plugin loading if set to a true value before this plugin would
normally load.

                                                        *b:dn_md_no_autoclean*
Prevents automatic deletion ("cleaning") of output artefacts when a buffer is
deleted or vim exits. For more information see |dn#util#cleanBuffer()|,
|dn#util#cleanAllBuffers()|, and |dn-md-utils-autocmds|.

==============================================================================
FEATURES                                                *dn-md-utils-features*

The major features of this plugin are support for yaml metadata blocks, adding
figures, and cleaning up output file and directories.

METADATA

Pandoc-flavoured markdown uses a yaml-style metadata block at the top of the
file to specify values used by pandoc for document processing. With panzer
(https://github.com/msprev/panzer) installed the metadata block can also
specify panzer-related values which, in turn, specify values used by pandoc
for document processing.

This ftplugin assumes the following default yaml-metadata block is used at the
top of documents:
>
    ---
    title:  "[][source]"
    author: "[][author]"
    date:   ""
    style:  [Standard, Latex12pt]  # panzer: 8-12,14,17,20pt; PaginateSections
    ---
<
The reference-style links are defined at the end of the document. The default
boilerplate for this is:
>
    [comment]: # (URLs)

       [author]:

       [source]:
<
The default metadata block and reference link definitions are added to a
document by the function |dn#md_util#addBoilerplate()|, which can be called
using the command |:MUAddBoilerplate| and mapping "<Leader>ab" (see
|dn-md-utils-mappings|).

Previously created markdown files have yaml metadata blocks that do not use
panzer. Those metadata blocks can be "panzerified" using the
|dn#md_util#panzerifyMetadata()| function, which can be called using the
command |:MUPanzerifyMetadata| and mapping "<Leader>pm" (see
|dn-md-utils-mappings|).

IMAGES

A helper function, mapping and command are provided to assist with adding
figures. They assume the images are defined using reference links with
optional attributes, and that all reference links are added to the end of the
document prefixed with three spaces. For example:
>
    See @fig:display and {@fig:packed}.

    ![Tuck boxes displayed][display]

    ![Tuck boxes packed away][packed]

    [comment]: # (URLs)

       [display]: resources/displayed.png "Tuck boxes displayed"
       {#fig:display .class width="50%"}

       [packed]: resources/packed.png "Tuck boxes packed away"
       {#fig:packed .class width="50%"}
<
A figure is inserted on the following line using the
|dn#md_util#insertFigure()| function, which can be called using the command
|:MUInsertFigure| and mapping "<Leader>fig" (see |dn-md-utils-mappings|).

OUTPUT

This plugin does not assist with generation of output, but does provide a
mapping, command and function for deleting output files and temporary output
directories. The term "clean" is used, as in the makefile keyword that deletes
all working and output files.

Cleaning of output only occurs if the current buffer contains a file. The
directory searched for items to delete is the directory in which the file in
the current buffer is located.

If the file being edited is FILE.ext, the files that will be deleted have
names like "FILE.html" and "FILE.pdf" (see |dn#md_util#cleanBuffer()| for a
complete list). The temporary output subdirectory ".tmp" will also be
recursively force deleted. Warning: This plugin does not check that it is safe
to delete files and directories identified for deletion. For example, it does
not check whether any of them are symlinks to other locations. Also be aware
that directories are forcibly and recursively deleted, as with the *nix shell
command "rm -fr".

When a markdown buffer is closed (actually when the |BufDelete| event occurs),
the plugin checks for output files/directories and, if any are found, asks the
user whether to delete them. If the user confirms deletion they are removed.
When vim exits (actually, when the |VimLeavePre| event occurs) the plugin
looks for any markdown buffers and looks in their respective directories for
output files/directories and, if any are found, asks the user whether to
delete them. See |dn-md-utils-autocmds| for further details.

Output files and directories associated with the current buffer can be deleted
at any time by using the |dn#md_util#cleanBuffer()| function, which can be
called using the command |:MUCleanOutput| and mapping "<Leader>co" (see
|dn-md-utils-mappings|).

==============================================================================
FUNCTIONS                                              *dn-md-utils-functions*

dn#md_util#addBoilerplate([insert])              *dn#md_util#addBoilerplate()*
  Adds panzer/markdown boilerplate to the top and bottom of the document.

  The [insert] boolean argument determines whether or not the function was
  entered from insert mode.
  [insert] is false if omitted.

dn#md_util#cleanAllBuffers([insert])            *dn#md_util#cleanAllBuffers()*
  Deletes common output artefacts: output files with extensions like "html"
  and "pdf", and temporary directories like ".tmp". (See
  |dn#util#cleanBuffer()| for a complete list.)

  Searches sequentially through all buffers that are both associated with a
  file name and have a markdown file type. When output artefacts are located
  the user is asked for confirmation before deletion.

  The [insert] argument has a boolean value which determines whether or not
  the function was entered from insert mode.
  [insert] is 0 if omitted.

dn#md_util#cleanBuffer({buffer_number}, [confirm], [insert])
                                                    *dn#md_util#cleanBuffer()*
  Deletes common output artefacts: output files with extensions "htm", "html",
  "pdf", "epub", and "mobi"; and temporary directories names ".tmp".

  Searches for output located in the file directory associated with buffer
  {buffer_number}.

  If [confirm] is true, the user will be asked for confirmation before
  deleting output artefacts. (If there are no artefacts the user is not asked
  for confirmation.)
  [confirm] is 0 if omitted.

  The [insert] argument has a boolean value which determines whether or not
  the function was entered from insert mode.
  [insert] is 0 if omitted.

dn#md_util#insertFigure([insert])                  *dn#md_util#insertFigure()*
  Inserts a figure on a new line.

  The [insert] boolean argument determines whether or not the function was
  entered from insert mode.
  [insert] is false if omitted.

dn#md_util#panzerifyMetadata([insert])        *dn#md_util#panzerifyMetadata()*
  Adds a line to the initial metadata block, if present, for panzer styles.
  Intended for use when converting from plain pandoc to pandoc-plus-panzer.

  The [insert] boolean argument determines whether or not the function was
  entered from insert mode.
  [insert] is false if omitted.

VARIABLES                                                   *dn-md-utils-vars*

This ftplugin contributes to the |dn-utils| plugin's help system (see
|dn#util#help()| for details). In the help system navigate to: vim -> markdown
ftplugin.

==============================================================================
AUTOCOMMANDS                                            *dn-md-utils-autocmds*

This plugin is configured to automatically clean output files and directories
associated with the current buffer when it is deleted (provided it is of
markdown file type), and to automatically clean output files and directories
associated with all markdown file buffers when vim exits. In all case the user
is asked for confirmation before any files or directories are deleted.

For more information on automatic cleaning see |dn#util#cleanBuffer()|.

The autocmds responsible for this behaviour can be found in the "dn_markdown"
autocmd group (see |autocmd-groups|) and can be viewed (see |autocmd-list|).

Automatic cleaning on buffer and vim exit can be configured with
|b:dn_md_no_autoclean|.
